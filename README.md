# Tree_Diameter_for_an_undirected_tree--graph
In this problem you will be given an undirected unweighted Tree graph G. You have to discover the diameter of the given tree. Tree diameter mainly indicates the largest distance found between any two nodes in the given tree. Distance means the number of edges between the nodes.
You will write a program that will calculate the diameter of the given undirected tree. For each test case you will print a single line denoting the diameter.
